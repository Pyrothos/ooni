# Specification version number

0.1.0

# Specification name

Vanilla Tor Test

# Test preconditions

* An internet connection

* Tor is installed

# Expected impact

Ability to determine if Tor in it's default configuration is able to bootstrap
or at what point in bootstrapping it fails.

# Expected inputs

None

# Test description

The test will run the tor executable and monitor the standard
output looking for a line in it's output indicating it has
bootstrapped to 100%.

# Expected output

## Parent data format

None

## Required output data

A flag to indicate if we were able to establish a Tor connection.

## Semantics

error:
    **string** indicating that an error occurred

    timeout-reached: to indicate tor was unable to bootstrap in the allocated time.

    null: no error was detected.

success:
    **boolean** indiciating if whether or not we were able to connect to the
    Tor network.

    True: indicates that we reached 100% bootstrap

    False: indicates that we were unable to reach 100% bootstrap before the
    timeout was reached.

    null: indicates that tor exited before we were able to complete the test,
    this can be due to some unhandled error.


timeout:
    **integer** indicating the timeout, in seconds, after which we should
    consider Tor as not working. The default it is set to 200 seconds.

transport_name:
    **string** always set to vanilla

tor_version:
    **string** indicating the version string of the tor client being used.

tor_progress:
    **integer** indicating the percentage of tor bootstrapping at which we
    stopped.

tor_progress_tag:
    **string** a string giving a textual description of what the progress
    percentage means.

tor_progress_summary:
    **string** a more verbose string giving a textual description of what the
    progress percentage state is.

tor_log:
    **string** notice level log output of tor.

## Possible conclusions

If Tor with the default configuration can successfully bootstrap.
